# CS334 - Parallel Computing

This repository contains tasks and materials related to the Parallel Computing subject (CS334) under the guidance of Eng. Mohammed El Gendy.

## Task 1: Login and Registration (Folder: task-1_login_and_registration)

In this task, we implemented a basic login and registration system using C. The program allows users to register with a username, password, email, phone number, address, and age. Registered users can then log in to view their information.

### Files
- `login_registration.c`: Contains the main C code for the login and registration system.
- `README.md`: This file.

### How to Run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the Task-1_login_and_registration directory.
3. Compile the C code using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc login_registration.c -o login_registration`).
4. Run the executable (e.g., `./login_registration`).

## Task 2: Active Users (Folder: task-2_active_users)

In this task, we extended the functionality of the login and registration system to include an 'active' status for users. A user can be marked as either active or inactive. Inactive users are denied access during login.

### Files
- `active_users.c`: Contains the updated C code with active user status functionality.

### How to Run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the Task-2_active_users directory.
3. Compile the C code using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc active_users.c -o active_users`).
4. Run the executable (e.g., `./active_users`).

### Additional Notes
- Make sure to review the source code for specific implementation details.
