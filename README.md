# CS353 - Parallel Computing

This repository contains tasks and materials related to the Parallel Computing subject (CS353) under the guidance of Eng. Mohammed El Gendy.

## Task 1: Login and Registration

### Description

In this task, we implemented a basic console-based login and registration system using C. It provides a simple menu for users to either log in or register.

### Files

- `login_registration.c`: This file contains the C code for the login and registration system.
- `README.md`: This file (you are here) provides an overview of the tasks and repository.

### Instructions

1. To compile and run the code, use a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
2. Execute the compiled binary to interact with the login and registration system.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to either log in or register.
